# Hessian_Aware_Sampling_in_High_Dimensions
Hessian-aware Bayesian sampling framework for high-dimensional inverse problems. Uses Hessian-vector products, randomized SVD for low-rank subspace, and preconditioned pCN/MALA/HMC to improve mixing. Produces calibrated posterior predictions beyond a single PDE model.
